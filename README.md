# JSBox issues board

As a developer tool, we want to track bugs and feature requests using a developer way, hence this repository is created.

If you have no context about what JSBox is, you probably went to a wrong place, and [this repo](https://github.com/cyanzhong/xTeko) can give you a brief idea, it is also available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1312014438).
